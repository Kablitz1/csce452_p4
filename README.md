For the 4th project of CSCE452

Known Bugs:
Do not click and hold, you will get more than one light in the same spot!

Go to the webpage using the team website. When the game loads you will have  blank screen with 3 buttons appear. 
  - Add Light will add a light to the game based on where you click
  - Add Robot will be followed with 3 prompts where you enter the K_Matrix, Desired Position, and give the robot a name
    - Prompt 1: The format is k11,k12,k21,k22 with no spaces between the commas
    - Prompt 2: The format is x,y with no spaces
    - Prompt 3: Any name will do. Just remember it to remove it!
  - Remove robot will prompt the user for the robot name and once you press OK the robot will be removed. 
  
Start by either adding lights or robots and then watch as they react to their surroundings!
