KNOWN BUGS:
Link1 and Link 2â€™s axis are correct with respect to each other, same with Link 2 and Link 3, 
however for some reason, Link 1 and Link 3 are off by a small amount when the Thetas are large. 
This is most likely due to the truncation of the sprites coordinates during calculations which 
are in integers in our game engine framework.
